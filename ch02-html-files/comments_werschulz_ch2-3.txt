Someplace in Chapter 2, I thought I had seen a statement saying that
CSS would be covered later in Chapter 3, but I can't seem to find it
right now.

pg 71: colgroup seems to work okay in Firefox (at least for the
example given).

pg 72: emacs has some nice tools for editing XHTML and CSS files,
which also provide validation.
