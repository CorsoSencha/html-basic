					&lt;h1&gt;Generations of the Last Two Decades&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;
							Have you ever wondered what people meant by &quot;Baby Boomers&quot; and
							&quot;Gen X&quot; and such?  Well, welcome to my Generation page where
							generational terms are explained!
					&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr /&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Baby Boomers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baby boomer is a person born
							between 1946 and 1964 in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada,
							or Australia. Following World War II, these countries experienced an
							unusual spike in birth rates, a phenomenon commonly known as the baby
							boom.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Generation Xers&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt; 
							Generation X can technically be defined as the generation
							following the Baby Boomers born between 1965 and 1980.  Generation Xers
							were brought up on television, Atari 2600s and personal computers. In
							addition, Generation X is noted as one of the most entrepreneurial and
							tech-friendly generations in American history, as they've driven a
							majority of the Internet's growth and ingenuity from day one.
					&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Generation Yers&lt;/h3&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;
					Unlike the generations that have gone 

			before them, Gen Y has been
					pampered, 
														 nurtured and programmed     with a slew of activities since they
					were toddlers, meaning they are both 
											high-performance 
			and
					high-maintenance.
				&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/body&gt;
